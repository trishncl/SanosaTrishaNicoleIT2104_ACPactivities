## 🔬 Laboratory Activity 1

In this activity, we focus on fundamental concepts such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and basic data handling. The program allow users to input song details and displays the information in a formatted output. Additionally, it works with characters, comparing them and displaying their corresponding ASCII values.
#### 💡 Purpose:
- To practice input/output operations and string formatting using `input()` and `f-strings`.
- To understand basic data types and perform data type conversions using functions like `ord()` and `chr()`.
- To explore ASCII values and character comparisons.

#### `lab1_item1.py` - Song Information Input
This program collects song details (year, genre, album, title, artist) and formats the output.

#### `lab1_item2.py` - Larger Character and ASCII Values
This program compares two characters and determines the one with a greater ASCII value.

## 🧮 Laboratory Activity 2

This activity focuses on loops, conditionals, and numeric operations, and involves tasks like checking for palindromes and calculating discounts based on user input.
#### 💡 Purpose:
- To apply loops and conditional logic for real-world applications like palindrome checking and discount calculation.
- To understand the use of `while` loops and how to manipulate numeric data.

#### `lab2_item1.py` - Integer Palindrome Checker
This program checks if a given integer is a palindrome.

</p>

#### `lab2_item2.py` - Purchase Discount Calculator
This program calculates the discount percentage based on the total purchase amount.

## 🔢 Laboratory Activity 3

This activity focuses on string and numeric-based problems and function creation. It includes Roman numeral converter and a program checking for perfect numbers. 
#### 💡 Purpose:
- To learn about numeral systems that relies on predefined values between Roman numerals and integers.
- To implement logic for checking perfect numbers using loops and conditionals.

#### `lab3_item1.py` - Roman Numerals to Integers
This program will convert Roman Numerals to its equivalent integer value.

## 🧑‍💻 Laboratory Activity 4

The goal of this activity is to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) and exception handling. It includes class creation, object instantiation, and handling exceptions such as `IndexError`.
#### 💡 Purpose:
- To understand the basics of OOP principles by defining classes and creating instances.
- To implement exception handling using `try` and `except` blocks to prevent errors and ensure the consistency of the program.

#### Capybara
###### `Capybara.py` - Class
The `Capybara.py` file contains a class that serves as a blueprint for creating capybara objects with attributes for their name, gender, and age.

###### `script.py` - Capybara Test Case Selection and Display
The `test_capybara_cases function` creates capybara objects, prompts the user to select a test case, and then displays the selected capybara's name, gender, and age.

</p>

#### Exception Handling
###### `lab4_item2.py`
This program prompts the user to input a size and elements of a double array `arr`, and handles errors using `IndexError`.
